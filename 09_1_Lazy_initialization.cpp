// Lazy initialization:
// It defers the creation of an object or resource until it is actually needed.

// Notes:
// 1) On-Demand Creation: The resource is created only when it is first accessed.
// 2) Resource Optimization: Reduces the memory footprint by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
// 3) Improved Performance: Can lead to faster startup times since not all resources are initialized upfront.

#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // Includes smart pointers like unique_ptr to manage the memory automatically.
#include <vector> // vector class to store signals.
